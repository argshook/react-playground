# React playground

My own boilerplate for starting simple React projects.

## How to do

1. `npm i -g babel-cli babel webpack mocha webpack-dev-server`
1. `npm i`

## How

1. `npm start` - for dev (server at [http://localhost:8080/](localhost:8080))
1. `npm run build` - for prod (will create `/dist`)

## test

with *mocha* and *chai*

1. `npm test` - once
1. `npm run test:watch` - guess what

## Todo

- [ ] Test coverage reports
- [ ] Figure out proper TDD
- [X] Redux
- [ ] Improve webpack dev/build configs
